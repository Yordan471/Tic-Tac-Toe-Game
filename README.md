# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a game in which two players take turns in drawing O's or X's in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares.
The first player to get three of the same symbols in a row, column or diagonal is the winner!

First starts the player with symbol 'X'. He can choose a square from the grid with coordinates for row (0-2) and column (0-2).
Lets pick 0 for row and 1 for column.

We will fill with symbol X the corresponding square on the grid.

Now for Player O we can pick coordinates that are different from the filled ones on the grid and are in 
the boundaries for row (0 - 2) and column (0 - 2). Lets pick 1 for row and 0 for column. The result is:

Thats how the game continues until there is a winner or we have a tie! The game is a tie when all 
squares on the grid are filled and there is no winner:

I've made some additions to the game like color for the different results, picking number of games
to be played at the start of the program,
